                        <p>Thailand’s beauty industry is growing fuelled by a strong economy and increasingly sophisticated consumers , including men who are proving to be a particularly lucrative market. There are many opportunities for both international as well as domestic companies in Thailand due to the strong economy, increasing demand a vibrant market in which new products and innovations are leading to growing competition. With 70 million consumers, the market in Thailand is thriving with the value of  the beauty and personal care market in Thailand growing by 8% just last year in 2012.</p>
                        <p>Thailand offers excellent business opportunities for anyone wishing to invest in this dynamic market. Strategically located at the heart of Asia, Thailand is also well placed to offer a gateway to both the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and Asia-Pacific markets which offer excellent business potential.</p>
                        <p>The ASEAN region alone has a cumulative population of more than 500 million and GDP in excess of US $700 billion. Thailand’s economy is in the top three in terms of size and volume of international trade. It is therefore well positioned as the region moves towards economic integration and a single free-trade area by 2015.</p>

                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Country</h3>
                            <p>Thailand, the only Southeast Asian nation never to have been colonized by European powers, is a constitutional monarchy whose current head of state is HM Bhumibol Adulyadej. A unified Thai kingdom has existed since the mid-14th century, and Thailand was known as Siam until 1939 when it officially became the Kingdom of Thailand.</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Capital</h3>
                            <p>Bangkok (Thais call "Krung Thep" meaning the city of angels.)</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Population</h3>
                            <p>The population of Thailand comprises of roughly 65 million citizens, the majority of whom are ethnically Thai, though peoples of Chinese, Indian, Malay, Mon, Khmer, Burmese, and Lao origin are also represented to varying degrees. Approximately 7 million citizens live in the capital city, Bangkok, though this number varies seasonally and is otherwise difficult to accurately count.</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Weather</h3>
                            <p>The weather in Thailand is generally hot and humid: typical of its location within the tropics. Generally speaking, Thailand can be divided into three seasons: “hot” season, rainy season, and “cool” season, though Thailand’s geography allows visitors to find suitable weather somewhere in the country throughout the year.</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">People</h3>
                            <p>The vast majority (roughly 80%) of Thailand’s nearly 65 million citizens are ethnically Thai. The remainder consists primarily of peoples of Chinese, Indian, Malay, Mon, Khmer, Burmese, and Lao decent. Of the 7 million citizens who live in the capital city, Bangkok, there is a greater diversity of ethnicities, including a large number of expatriate residents from across the globe. Other geographic distinctions of the population include a Muslim majority in the south near the Malaysian border, and hill tribe ethnic groups, such as the Hmong and Karen, who live in the northern mountains.</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Language</h3>
                            <p>More than 92% of the population speaks Thai or one of it’s regional dialects. While the Thai language is the official language of Thailand, as a result of its cosmopolitan capital city and established tourism infrastructure, English is spoken and understood throughout much of Thailand.</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Religion</h3>
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li class="list-item">94.6% of Thais are Buddhist</li>
                                <li class="list-item">4.6% of Thais are Muslim</li>
                                <li class="list-item">0.7% of Thais are Christian</li>

                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Time</h3>
                            <p>Thailand Standard time is GMT +7. Thailand does not observe daylight savings.</p>

                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Government</h3>
                            <p>Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, not dissimilar to England’s, whereby an elected Prime Minister is authorized to be the head of government and a hereditary Thai King is head of state. The constitution of Thailand allows for the people of Thailand to democratically elect their leaders in the form of a parliament, with a bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives, and executive authority in the hands of the Prime Minister. A Judiciary, overseen by the Supreme Court, was designed to act independently of the executive and the legislature.</p>

                            <p>The economy of Thailand is reliant on exports, which account for 60% of Thailand’s approximately US$ 200 billion GDP. The economy of Thailand is the 2nd largest in Southeast Asia. Thailand’s exports consist primarily of agricultural products including fish and rice, of which it is the largest exporter in the world, as well as textiles, rubber, automobiles, computers and other electronic appliances, and jewelry. While one of the premier tourist destinations in the world, Thailand relies on tourism to provide only 7 % of its GDP.</p>
                            <h3 class="name  open-sansbold">Currency</h3>
                            <p>The currency of Thailand is the Thai Baht. Baht come in both coin and banknote form. The size of Thai currency, both coins and bills increases with value and varies in color….</p>
