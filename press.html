              <img src="img/20100419602891.jpg" class="press-img" /></h1>
<p>UBM Asia is pleased to announce the launch of ASEANbeauty, the only beauty trade event supported by the Thai Cosmetics Manufacturers Association. This is to be the premier international beauty trade show for South East Asia taking place in Thailand from 8-10 April, 2015 at the Bangkok International Trade & Exhibition Centre.</p>
<p>Thailand's beauty industry is growing, fuelled by a strong economy and increasingly sophisticated consumers, including the men's market which is proving to be particularly lucrative. With 70 million potential consumers, the market in Thailand for beauty and personal care products grew 8% in 2012. There are many opportunities for both international as well as domestic companies in this vibrant market, which values new and innovative products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is a strategic region, where economic growth and development is expected to exceed the global average. A wealth of natural resources, low-cost skilled labour and regional economic integration with the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015 have attracted businesses keen to explore the vibrant new domestic markets that are emerging in ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASEANbeauty will be the leading industry event where companies looking to expand in Southeast Asia will be able to build business network and gain industry insights through seminars and educational workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ketmanee Lertkitcha, President of The Thai Cosmetic Manufacturers Association and supporting partner of ASEANbeauty, welcomes the event: "We are proud to support ASEAN beauty as the market is ready for a fair representing the Southeast Asia region. The event will be the best place not only to meet potential buyers and distributors, but also to observe trends and gather market intelligence."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Visitors can expect to meet over 200 leading suppliers covering personal care, skin care, hair care, nail care including cosmetics, fragrances, raw ingredients, salon supplies, natural heath products, hair products, nails and accessories from Asia and countries around the world in a truly global marketplace," said M Gandhi, Managing Director, UBM ASEAN Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASEANbeauty will take place at the Bangkok International Trade & Exhibition Centre from 8-10 April 2015 in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
